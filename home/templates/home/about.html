                Fotolio is a small, focused collection of original photography
                designed to live on real walls – not just on screens.
            </p>

                    Every image is captured, edited, and curated by the same creator,
                    so the gallery feels consistent in mood, contrast, and storytelling.
                    You won’t scroll through thousands of random styles – just a tight
                    selection that works together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is simple: make it easy to choose prints that feel cinematic,
                    modern, and considered – whether you are building a full gallery wall
                    or just looking for one strong hero piece.
